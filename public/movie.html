<h1>Shosh's Favorite Films</h1>
<h2>These are my top three.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>My Cousin Vinny</h3>
<p>This film is really funny and has held up over time. It doesn't feel dated.</p>
<h3>About Time</h3>
<p>This film is a sweet love story, but also a beautiful way of showing the importance of the little moments in life. </p>
<h3>Robin Hood</h3>
<p>This animated classic was a childhood favorite, and I still love the story. </p>
